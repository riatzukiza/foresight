# Local cephalon: operational evidence, 2026-10-06

## Outcome and scope

OpenHax is running as the local Knoxx creative agent and Discord-facing head.
The operator authorized continuous creation and publication to the configured
Bluesky account and home Discord channels. Real lyrics, artwork and music have
been created and delivered. Strong isolation, publication admission and recovery
guarantees are still planned work in the personal development
[Foresight PR22](https://github.com/riatzukiza/foresight/pull/22).
This report records observed behavior, not completion of that epic.

The deployment is `/home/err/.local/share/promethean/services/knoxx-social-local`.
Docker Compose owns its backend, frontend, local Atlas vector-search stack and
host-service bridge. Existing unrelated PM2 services were not changed.

## Reproducible read-only inspection

```bash
nbb scripts/verify_cephalon_local.cljs --only knoxx
```

Run on the owning local host. The explicit selector is required. This command
verifies the served image and contract hashes before inspecting authenticated
configuration, recent completed clock-run records and public publication identities.
It does not invoke an agent,
publish, mutate contracts or transition cards. Earlier captured output is
`/home/err/.local/share/promethean/services/knoxx-social-local/verification-cephalon.txt`.
An unavailable dependency or changed image remains a failure.
The latest inspection has **12 passing checks, seven explicit operational
warnings, and zero failures**. Warnings are preserved; this is an inspection
result, not admission of the planned guarantees.

MiMo reviews5434041449 and5434223876 identified a nonblocking manifest edge:
an absent or empty `files` declaration could pass the prior hash check vacuously.
The diagnostic now requires a non-empty vector before checking hashes, and stops
before authenticated runtime inspection on either a missing file list or hash
drift. Three isolated temporary fixtures reproduced the prior runtime-query path
and verified that the successor exits1 before that path for missing files, empty
files and a changed hash. Those fixtures replace the process boundary; they do
not alter the deployment or invoke its APIs. The actual240-file manifest passes
the updated diagnostic. This hardens evidence collection, not runtime behavior.

MiMo review5434877321 identified a separate sampling error: the three most
recent Bluesky posts can legitimately all be music announcements without an
image. A bounded feed window cannot impose image frequency on the runtime.
The diagnostic now checks a successful, structurally valid public feed read;
an image in that sample is an observation, while its absence is a warning.
An unavailable or malformed feed remains a failure. The12-check count is
unchanged; an image-free sample adds one warning to the seven known gaps.

Committed process-boundary fixtures in `test/verify_cephalon_local_test.cljs`
use real temporary manifest/contract bytes and stub external commands. They
cover explicit selection, wrong image, missing/empty/non-vector file lists,
hash drift, a mixed feed, three text-only posts, an empty valid feed, and an
unavailable or malformed feed. Importing the diagnostic performs no inspection.
The former image-window behavior reproduced the failure before correction;
the successor passes7tests/26assertions. The hosted deterministic workflow now
runs these fixtures as `cephalon_diagnostic`; a local pass is preparation,
not evidence that a newly pushed hosted job has completed.

Rheos's native `content` read preserves the creative card's scalar dependency
UUID, epic, parent and incoming metadata. That read does not validate dependency
admission or move a card. The native `frontmatter points` command refuses the
unsupported key; no board state was changed. The3-point head estimate remains
provisional: its7criteria exercise the existing admission/runner/tool boundaries,
while the5-point cycle and recovery stories additionally cover durable terminal
ownership and deployment/reconciliation. Criterion count alone is not a workload
measure; no ready-state capacity or implementation duration is asserted.

An independent read-only inspection subsequently resolved the scalar-input
question against installed eta-mu1.1.1 / Rheos0.1.0. The native task loader drops
dependency metadata before task-schema validation and transition gates.
Using immutable33b8ff0card bytes, native pre-write schema, transition and gate
functions allowed all three scalar-bearing cards for `incoming → accepted`;
the task projection contained no dependency field. A native WIP control still
refused `todo → in_progress` at50tasks. These are executed pre-write checks,
not actual admission, dependency-edge validation or predecessor enforcement.
Changing a scalar to a vector would not supply the missing graph behavior.
The installed CLI bundle SHA256 is
`fba8bef53a9dbc159136de56f5a3c174af33b0d309ae0a26fce440467b50590c`.
Upstream [Rheos issue3](https://github.com/open-hax/rheos/issues/3) already
tracks relationship retention/authoring and graph admission; its separate
personal planning PR4 remains a prerequisite proposal, not an installed fix.
No second parser, validator or board writer was introduced.

Observed preparation gates: root workspace tests passed (24 tests, 120 assertions),
`clj-kondo --lint scripts test` passed with zero warnings or errors, and
`git diff --check` passed. These checks do not qualify the Knoxx source hotfix or
establish unattended operation across host sleep.

## Served identities and ownership

| Boundary | Observed identity |
| --- | --- |
| Backend container | `knoxx-social-local-backend-1`, UID1000, healthy |
| Served image | `knoxx-backend:social-local-2644fc6-creative` |
| Image ID | `sha256:ce0123ef17bade99603ea6ea19967c99c62869118d1cf52c057ab6a72500bf14` |
| Contract snapshot source | Knoxx `40221a69f7fff675b46614d9ab318b4ef52f3786` plus explicitly recorded local overlays |
| Local HTTP / UI | loopback ports18881 /18882 |
| Discord bot | `OpenHax#8539`, identity450177073990860801 |
| Actor / model | `discord_automation` / `deepinfra/google/gemma-4-31B-it` |
| Background agent | `ussyverse_social_creative` |
| Conversation agent | `ussyverse_social_replies` |
| Creative cadence | native Knoxx schedule `*/15 * * * *` |
| Additional trigger | `:cephalon/creative-request` |
| Native internal control | backend loopback `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; separate `cephalon_control` knowledge-worker principal |

The image is based on an older Knoxx build; the later contract snapshot is not a
claim that that source revision was compiled. The deployment manifest retains
per-file SHA256 hashes, overlay descriptions and the actual image ID. The local
image adds the missing synthesis script and runtime dependencies.

The cloud Knoxx deployment retains `KNOXX_DISABLE_EVENT_RUNTIMES=true` in its
Compose definition. Only this local deployment currently owns the Discord/event
consumer. Do not enable both consumers with the same bot identity. Cloud
availability and mesh failover remain unverified.

## Native artifacts and independently observed deliveries

| Activity | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Lyrics cycle | completed run `bfb2a6b7-f74a-4cea-9ab7-b5133ccc1821`; `Music/cephalon/lyrics.txt` |

Artifact paths above are relative to the persistent deployment `state/workspace`.
The final WAV was independently measured with ffprobe and ffmpeg: mean volume
-20.3dB, maximum -1.4dB. It contains real audio. The verified12-second project
supersedes an earlier4-second diagnostic clip whose retries did not retain a
reliable final-spec binding.

Detailed native observations are stored under the deployment `state/` as
`cephalon-*-admission-20261006.json`, `cephalon-*-persisted-20261006.json`,
`cephalon-publication-observation-20261006.json`, and
`cephalon-music-discord-observation-20261006.json`. Credentials remain private;
they are not committed or included in this report.

## Responsive head during a working maker

Run `dbb28bda-2023-40c5-ad14-69dbcc4b6f6d` was admitted at18:38:33.204UTC.
The HTTP admission took1298ms. Its native Discord send completed at18:38:38.781UTC
(about5.6seconds after admission), message1557099786027663361:

> I'm available to chat while my maker keeps working. 💅

The existing maker run continued with the same identity, published at18:38:59UTC,
and completed at18:39:18UTC. The conversation probe did not abort or steer it.
This was an explicitly authorized direct HTTP probe. It was not a fabricated
human Discord message, and it bypassed event FIFO admission. It demonstrates
independent HTTP conversation while a maker runs; it does **not** prove reserved
Discord reply capacity under a saturated queue.

A real operator Discord message, `Lol`, also arrived while the12-second music
maker was running. The gateway event was admitted at18:47:54.390UTC as
`trigger-ussyverse_social-replies-1494137016303095828-evt_1791312474355-1791312474377`.
Its native send returned message1557102136226087014 with timestamp18:47:58.835UTC,
about4.5seconds after admission. The reply run completed at18:48:02.466UTC;
the music maker retained its identity and finished at18:49:41.406UTC. This
observes the actual Discord event path with one maker active, while leaving the
saturation law unproven.

## Known failures and current fallbacks

1. Event-triggered replies and makers still share a FIFO. Concurrency2 supplies
   two shared slots, not a reserved conversation lane. Planned law tests must
   hold a maker and saturate its lane while admitting and completing a reply.
2. Publication cadence is prompt guidance. The real artwork post occurred only
   about10minutes after the lyrics post, violating the proposed30-minute
   guidance. Enforced reservation, deduplication and frequency admission are
   required source work, not a proven configuration property.
3. Native `music.generate` renders a WAV, then erroneously JSON-parses the
   promisified `execFile` result object instead of its stdout. The maker now has
   guidance to use the **same packaged engine** through native `bash`, retain
   the actual spec and verify the resulting WAV. A narrow source/packaging
   regression fix is in an isolated worktree with tests first.
4. The configured image provider returned403 `provider_not_allowed`. Original
   SVG creation and native Bluesky rasterization succeeded. This is a functional
   creative fallback, not a claim that provider image generation is working.
5. The owning host can sleep. As of20:10:50UTC, four natural clock cycles had
   completed, with an intentional idle backend recreation between the second
   and third. This proves resumed scheduling after that recreation, not uninterrupted cadence,
   in-flight job recovery, cloud placement or mesh ownership recovery.
6. The first artwork post had empty alt text. The current maker prompt now requires
   `imageAlts`; accessibility enforcement remains part of publication work.
7. `domain.event.dispatch/status-snapshot` hardcodes `:running true`. The
   configuration API therefore cannot establish runtime liveness. The diagnostic
   instead checks a recent completed persisted schedule-origin run and explicitly
   labels the API field as a constant. Cloud disabled banners, the absence of
   creative schedules and the served flag guard were independently inspected;
   the cloud API's `running` value is not proof of a second live consumer.
8. Artifact quality and delivery remain advisory. The second natural music
   cycle saved9.742seconds of real audio rather than the proposed12–20seconds,
   with990saturated PCM samples out of859,240 (about0.115%). Its Discord send
   was a notice with zero attachments. Retain that result; do not label it a
   verified12-second delivered musical project. The earlier direct12-second
   project remains the verified audio attachment proof.
9. Acknowledgment order and child identity are still prompt guidance. The
   acknowledge-first probe batched send and spawn, admitted a default-contract
   child rather than the requested maker and retained no tool-backed artifact.
   Native ordering and strict delegated-spec validation are explicit head-story
   acceptance criteria; an accepted child is not evidence of completed work.

## Internal delegation boundary repair

The first direct head delegation probe, run
`6a4df1d2-1636-47a2-aec7-291a2e33a85f`, failed four `agents.spawn` attempts
with `fetch failed` and never sent its acknowledgment. The deployment had
incorrectly set `KNOXX_BASE_URL` to the host's frontend loopback port18882.
Inside the backend container that address is not its own API.

The Compose declaration now sets `KNOXX_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`;
public/frontend URLs retain their distinct purpose. The backend was recreated
only after independently checking zero active runs and zero persisted running
or queued jobs. Its image ID and persistent database/contracts/artifacts remain
the recorded ones; Docker health returned healthy. This is an observed idle
recreation, not a pending-job recovery proof. It rearms the creative clock.

The native control client additionally supplies the fixed header identity
`system-admin@open-hax.local`. The local instance had not provisioned it; a
native-header context read returned401 while the configured operator key alone
returned200. Through the existing Knoxx admin API, a separate internal control
principal was created in the existing Open-Hax org, actor `cephalon_control`,
with the existing **knowledge-worker** role. No human account or bot credential
was reassigned. Its identity is `d2a25d4c-a82c-4fde-b9fe-f22ecceaec0c`.
Native-header context now returns200 and grants `agent.chat.use`.
The diagnostic verifies this exact internal origin and usable principal.

A repeat head probe, `aeda4003-75a4-4c44-b025-dd90b64c4b85`, was admitted
at19:34:58.907UTC. Native `agents.spawn` accepted maker
`735a8ae4-ef5c-4123-9b1e-c3e584e5583c` at19:35:15.752UTC.
The head delivered Discord acknowledgment1557114088843124748 with that actual
run identity at19:35:28.561UTC, then completed at19:35:46.064UTC. The child
continued independently until19:35:47.651UTC and wrote an original130-byte
four-line poem at `Music/cephalon/delegation-proof/20261006T193524Z.txt`
and a159-byte receipt at workspace-root `receipt.txt`. No publication was
requested from this verification child. The retained parent/child snapshots are
`state/cephalon-delegation-and-cycle3-persisted-20261006.json`.

The acknowledgment took about30seconds because the probe dispatched first.
The head contract was adjusted to acknowledge before spawning, exactly once,
with no completion or acceptance claim before its receipt. Its live reload
occurred at19:52UTC, without a process restart, and rearms the native clock.
The next direct verification run, `fbd5ed6a-3bc3-4cb7-8153-a109c90fd155`,
was admitted at19:53:19.460UTC. The model emitted both tools in one batch:
spawn began at19:53:40.069UTC, send at19:53:40.081UTC, and Discord
acknowledgment1557118669673209968 arrived at19:53:40.716UTC (about21.3seconds).
It omitted the required maker contract/model from its specification. The
accepted child `47b62c5f-373b-4644-ad50-7a9f31265d04` therefore resolved to
`knoxx_default`, completed with no tool receipts and did not provide artifact
proof. The snapshot is `state/cephalon-ack-first-persisted-20261006.json`.
This failed the intended acknowledgment-before-admission and child-identity
contracts. It was an authorized direct probe, not a fabricated operator event.
Do not infer that the prompt update guarantees either property.

Source work should enforce that ordering, reject unsupported delegated shapes,
and replace the client's borrowed fixed header identity with explicit
instance/actor authentication. The earlier correctly specified asynchronous
maker proof remains valid; the later failed-shape probe is retained separately.

The foreground contract has four allowed tools: Discord send/read/react and
asynchronous `agents.spawn`. It disables thinking and passive-memory delays,
and uses a bounded24-message context. The maker retains creation, publication
and delegation tools. Conversation does not explicitly cancel or reset it.

## Review and continuation

### Personal development review routing

The operator explicitly corrected PR placement: development reviews belong
inside the `riatzukiza` forks so CodeRabbit uses that account's subscription.
The replacement targets are
[Foresight PR22](https://github.com/riatzukiza/foresight/pull/22) and
[Knoxx PR3](https://github.com/riatzukiza/knoxx/pull/3), stacked on the existing
personal synchronization candidates PR3 and PR1 respectively. Both base and
head repositories are personal. The original org PR136/386 remain review
provenance, with native finding and scope evidence preserved; their approvals
and completed rounds do not qualify the new personal PRs.

Ordinary merges retain both histories, the exact personal sync-base ledger
prefixes and the owned source suffixes in original order. Each development
branch tracks its personal remote. Personal Knoxx's inherited eager
`auto-merge.yml` workflow was disabled and read back as `disabled_manually`
before review readiness. No main update, force push, release, staging admission,
live deployment or maker interruption occurred. Included CodeRabbit plan/quota
must be read from the actual personal native response; org cooldowns do not
establish personal availability, and no on-demand credits are enabled.
At initial migration the personal Knoxx secret-name inventory was empty. Its
first native MiMo attempt failed that actual publisher precondition; the existing
operator-owned App identity and active personal installation were authenticated
before configuring encrypted review credentials and retrying the failed attempt.
The inherited Kimi workflow received its existing named Coding credential after
the initial model-unavailable failure. Its retry reached the provider and failed
on the account's weekly quota at22:15:19UTC; that response grants no review or
approval and does not authorize extra usage. These availability changes grant no
review completion or approval. The existing backend/frontend CI was manually dispatched
on the immutable personal head because its automatic PR trigger only targets
`main`. Organization infrastructure remains the separately qualified
release/deployment destination.

Both native personal CodeRabbit responses report **Plan: Essentials**.
[Foresight review5435159871](https://github.com/riatzukiza/foresight/pull/22#pullrequestreview-5435159871)
completed at22:17:15UTC on efdc61c, selecting14files and posting one actionable
publication privacy finding. Its native footer says the included allowance was
used, zero reviews remain, and the current adjusted allowance is one review/hour.
The personal plan therefore does not prove a fixed five-review hourly allowance.
Knoxx's native summary6026248743 was still processing10files at22:07:20UTC.
Exact response bytes and SHA256s are retained under
`.ημ/review-evidence/cephalon-personal-forks/` and referenced by the receipt ledger.
Account selection and file selection alone do not supply complete substantive
scope, an approval or a completed cohort round. No on-demand credits were enabled.
The original org development PRs are closed as superseded, with native evidence
and replacement links preserved.

The publication story now explicitly requires the existing access policy to
permit each artifact for its selected Bluesky or Discord destination. Denial
must cause no external write, and separate negative tests for both adapters are
part of its planned red phase. This fixes native finding4200965630 as a planning
criterion; those runtime guarantees and tests have not yet been implemented.
Card identity, frontmatter and incoming state are unchanged.

### Planning review snapshot at20:12UTC

PR136 contains an incoming epic and four UUID-linked stories. All three initial
CodeRabbit planning findings and all four findings from review5433964852 have
verified specification/diagnostic fixes and explanatory settlements. All six
native finding threads are resolved; the outside-diff saturation item is settled
in native comment6024516276. The successor still needs its own qualification.
The second pass now requires fully saturated maker admission fixtures, proven
termination/fencing before stale-owner re-admission, fresh linked operator-retry
identities with immutable exhausted history, and an anonymous-auth statement
limited to the actual GET observation. These are acceptance criteria, not
implemented guarantees. CodeRabbit's quota reply6024485582 at20:06:27UTC gives
51minutes until included review. Because the native minutes are rounded, use
20:58:27UTC as the conservative earliest retry and refresh the native cooldown
and pending-request evidence first. Codex reports account quota.
Neither condition supplies approval. Cards have not been moved to ready.

### Historical org planning evidence and complete-input gap

The timestamped cycle-count correction at33b8ff0 resolves MiMo's later P3
finding from review5434397188, with native explanations4200530092 and6025642304.
Seven finding threads are resolved; this does not establish readiness.
On33b8ff0, hosted run37532731281 completed successfully and native
[MiMo review5434877321](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/pull/136#pullrequestreview-5434877321)
approved at21:40:51UTC after assessing all11full-diff pages. That approval is
historical once the diagnostic, tests and planning clarifications advance the head.
Its sampling and committed-coverage observations are addressed above; the
creative-cycle story now names where it implements limits specified by the
publication/recovery stories. The current PR body already reports12checks.

CodeRabbit's automatic33b8ff0 run completed at21:21:24UTC with a no-actionable
verdict and an exact-head marker, but skipped `.ημ/receipts.edn` as similar.
Authenticated native
[clarification6025753621](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/pull/136#issuecomment-6025753621)
at21:26:04UTC explicitly confirms that the five new receipt records at
lines200–204 were excluded from substantive review. That clarification does
not retroactively assess them, request another review, or grant approval/round
credit. The full native JSON response bytes and their SHA256 identities are
retained under `.ημ/review-evidence/foresight-pr136/` and in the receipt ledger.

A fresh canonical CLI still reports CodeRabbit eligible despite that admission.
[Upstream issue24](https://github.com/riatzukiza/.agents/issues/24) tracks the
decisive-scope parser gap; no local classifier or policy waiver is introduced.
That org planning head remained unqualified. Included allowance was0remaining at
one review/hour, with a conservative22:23UTC retry boundary recorded before
the personal migration. This is historical cooldown evidence for the closed
org PR, not a request instruction for the replacement personal PR. A new full
review must assess every changed input, including receipts and retained evidence.
Another clarification or passing CI cannot repair omitted scope.
The latest Codex invitation received account quota in6025648426; it grants
neither approval nor round credit. Root has no configured native Kimi workflow.

The active `cephalon-runtime-follow-up` heartbeat continues operational inspection,
review settlement and the authorized implementation flow every30minutes, staying
quiet when nothing actionable changes. **Knoxx's own clock creates the art**;
the heartbeat is maintenance and continuation, not the creative scheduler.

The narrow native music correctness/packaging fix is pushed as
[Knoxx PR386](https://github.com/open-hax/knoxx/pull/386), ready at
`4fc1245f6373f0994cbecb7533caff91301b37a2`. It has a real failing regression
commit followed by passing native and full functional suites (1,848tests /
9,107assertions),75smoke tests, and production compile/release with zero
compiler warnings. Full lint and error-boundary checks retain confirmed
unchanged baseline failures. The live older image was correctly refused by
the source verifier. It has not been deployed. Native CodeRabbit completed an
exact-head no-actionable review. Original hosted backend/frontend CI passed.
Those results are historical after the later documentation-only successor.
Codex reports account quota and Kimi reports weekly quota; neither supplies
approval or round credit. Knoxx's documented procedure was followed when
marking ready: the legacy enabling job completed, its eager SQUASH auto-merge
was disabled, and native `autoMergeRequest:null` was verified afterward.

Three required author walkthrough notes explain the diff and request no
correction. The hosted all-thread gate and canonical settlement classifier
currently treat them as unsettled findings. They remain intact and unresolved;
no author self-settlement or reviewer impersonation is used. This additional
instance is recorded on the existing upstream
[informational-thread contract issue22](https://github.com/riatzukiza/.agents/issues/22#issuecomment-6024302534).
A different authenticated repository writer can independently verify and
handle them under current policy. The canonical review-convergence gate remains
unsatisfied independently of these conversations. No merge policy was waived.

The source branch subsequently advanced to
`e8c00838fb773c50aeba98dae623b8ca2c5e607d` with accurate verifier JSDoc and an
append-only receipt. The documentation-only patch preserves prior executable
bytes; syntax checks and the actual native-engine source proof pass3tests /
18assertions. Native explanation6024452306 addresses the concrete missing
documentation without claiming a newly measured hosted coverage percentage.
Prior4fc1245 approvals and CI are historical after that push. Fresh hosted
backend/frontend CI passed on e8c0083, including the later same-head
[job112481722026](https://github.com/open-hax/knoxx/actions/runs/37525610814/job/112481722026).
At20:18UTC, the canonical CLI requested the successor's full review in native
comment6024678217 after the calculated cooldown. The native acknowledgment
still reported3seconds remaining, showing that a rounded-minute estimate was
slightly early. The review subsequently completed using the included allowance;
no paid credits were activated.

The [CodeRabbit summary6023699916](https://github.com/open-hax/knoxx/pull/386#issuecomment-6023699916),
edited20:24:25UTC, reports no actionable comments, processes all10changed files,
and records exact-head reviewed coverage for e8c0083. Its measured verifier
docstring coverage is100.00% across5functions in2files. Native
[MiMo review5434124920](https://github.com/open-hax/knoxx/pull/386#pullrequestreview-5434124920)
also approves the exact same commit with no confirmed findings. Its diff-hygiene
gate and source review do not imply that it ran the functional suites or verified
the deployment.

MiMo's nonblocking SDK metadata question is answered in native
[comment6024880021](https://github.com/open-hax/knoxx/pull/386#issuecomment-6024880021).
The installed, lock-matching MCP SDK1.29.0 uses a loose result schema; a read-only
in-memory response passed through its actual server-result, JSON-RPC and
client-result schemas without losing any music metadata in `details`.
Knoxx's inspected registration forwards that shape without an output schema.
This verifies that dependency path, not a deployed e8c0083 container. MiMo's
separate nonblocking request-rejection and temporary-directory cleanup coverage
observations remain acknowledged without an invented correction or test result.

The canonical CLI now recognizes exact-head CodeRabbit and MiMo approvals.
It still reports0of5completed code rounds because the configured cohort includes

### Unattended-cycle observations

The last contract reload armed the900000ms interval at18:47:39.383UTC.
The first natural tick admitted run
`trigger-ussyverse-social_creative-cron-creative-evt_1791313360070-1791313360119`
at19:02:40.141UTC. Its persisted event type is
`schedule/ussyverse-social-creative` and schedule ID is `creative`.
The run completed at19:04:36.231UTC. It wrote an original972-byte SVG,
rendered a36,603-byte PNG at `Graphics/cephalon/20261006T190257Z/cover.png`,
published [Bluesky post3mxa4nzbky52i](https://bsky.app/profile/open-hax.bsky.social/post/3mxa4nzbky52i),
and delivered native Discord message1557106110517870624 with one attachment.
Its retained `receipt.json` records the outcomes. The full native run observation
is `state/cephalon-natural-cycle-1-persisted-20261006.json`.
This publication occurred about24.5minutes after the preceding image post,
again showing that the proposed30-minute guidance is not enforced.

The second natural tick admitted
`trigger-ussyverse-social_creative-cron-creative-evt_1791314259386-1791314259438`
at19:17:39.457UTC and completed at19:19:51.753UTC. It wrote an original
composition spec, lyrics,9.741950seconds of audible stereo44.1kHz WAV
(1,718,524bytes) and a receipt at `Music/cephalon/20261006T191747Z/`.
It published [Bluesky post3mxa5jl6uub2h](https://bsky.app/profile/open-hax.bsky.social/post/3mxa5jl6uub2h)
and native Discord notice1557109977469026344 (zero attachments).
The full native run is `state/cephalon-natural-cycle-2-persisted-20261006.json`.
This is a second completed unattended cycle and a second media type.

After the idle recreation, the clock armed at19:29:08.930UTC and naturally
admitted `trigger-ussyverse-social_creative-cron-creative-evt_1791315849095-1791315849121`
at19:44:09.132UTC. It completed at19:47:06.306UTC, saving an original1,287-byte
SVG, a rendered PNG and a391-byte receipt under
`Graphics/cephalon/20261006T194427Z/`. It published
[Bluesky post3mxa6z2iyxf2y](https://bsky.app/profile/open-hax.bsky.social/post/3mxa6z2iyxf2y)
at19:45:35.566UTC, with one image and descriptive alt text independently
observed through the public API, then delivered native Discord
message1557116763865481359 with one attachment at19:46:06.336UTC.
The native run is in `state/cephalon-delegation-and-cycle3-persisted-20261006.json`;
the public read is `state/cephalon-cycle3-publication-observation-20261006.json`.
This is the third completed natural cycle. The idle recreation deliberately
interrupts the cadence series and does not establish pending-job recovery.

After the head contract reload, the fourth natural clock run
`trigger-ussyverse-social_creative-cron-creative-evt_1791317265366-1791317265373`
was admitted at20:07:45.381UTC and completed at20:10:50.173UTC. It saved a
2,112-byte composition specification with numeric duration16,258bytes of
lyrics, a433-byte receipt and `Music/cephalon/20261006T200800Z/sketch.wav`.
Independent ffprobe reads16.000seconds, stereo44.1kHz PCM,2,822,444bytes.
ffmpeg measures mean-15.4dB and maximum0dB;1,464of1,411,200PCM samples are
saturated (about0.104%). The length and attachment are verified, while
quality admission remains advisory.

It published the independently observed text announcement
[Bluesky post3mxaaec6q7k2p](https://bsky.app/profile/open-hax.bsky.social/post/3mxaaec6q7k2p),
with no audio/video embed. Native Discord message1557122767516598314 at
20:09:57.718UTC carries one `sketch.wav` attachment. An independent authenticated
Discord GET returned200 and verified the bot author, filename, `audio/wav`
content type and matching2,822,444-byte size. The native run and independent
outlet observations are retained as `state/cephalon-natural-cycle-4-persisted-20261006.json`,
`state/cephalon-cycle4-discord-observation-20261006.json` and
`state/cephalon-cycle4-publication-observation-20261006.json`.
The run also retains a failed optional `jq` probe (binary absent) and an
unauthenticated HTTP probe returning `AuthMissing`; native authenticated
publication/delivery succeeded. No failed tool result is hidden or used as
success evidence.

Reloading a contract rearms the current native interval, so repeated prompt
edits would postpone this proof. No manually dispatched cycle is counted as
unattended-clock evidence.
