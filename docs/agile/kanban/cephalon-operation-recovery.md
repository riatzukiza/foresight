## Context

The cloud is intended as an always-available entry/worker, with up to five mesh
devices appearing and disappearing. The current recovered consumer is local;
that placement cannot create while its host is asleep.

## Outcome

The intended always-available host supervises one head identity and durable work.
Optional mesh makers can disappear without losing or duplicating accepted jobs.

## Scope

Services-owned deployment declarations, persistent contracts/output/database
storage, truthful model/embedding/voice health, bounded recovery and a placement
runbook. Reuse existing event/job replay and identity seams.

## Non-goals

Deploy a new mesh scheduler, migrate unrelated database users, change every PM2
process, or make cloud worker availability depend on an operator laptop service.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Document and verify one active gateway/clock owner; relocation disables the
   old owner persistently before enabling its successor.
2. Recreate the backend with a pending job. Within 60 seconds, the recovered
   owner must inspect persisted job identity and previous ownership. Re-admit
   pending work only after the previous owner and its delegated work are
   confirmed terminated, or verified fencing prevents them from persisting
   artifacts and publishing. Ten-minute deadline expiry alone is insufficient:
   after expiry, test an old owner that still attempts both effects and prove
   rejection before re-admission. Ambiguous termination or fencing keeps the
   work quarantined with an explicit outcome. Do not cancel a live owner within
   its valid execution deadline. Preserve artifact identity. Reconcile any
   unknown publication outcome against the
   native outlet before retrying; if unresolved, mark the attempt ambiguous
   and require explicit retry rather than republishing. Observe three cycles.
3. Each creative execution has a ten-minute deadline and at most three total
   attempts per cycle identity. Failed attempts wait one minute, then five
   minutes before the remaining attempts; no immediate retry loop. Exhaustion
   yields a persisted failed outcome and a meaningful alert, then waits for the
   next scheduled cycle or an authorized explicit operator retry. That retry
   creates a fresh cycle identity linked to the exhausted predecessor, with its
   own three-attempt cap; the predecessor's failed outcome and attempt history
   are immutable. A fresh identity does not bypass maker reservation, publication
   deduplication or ambiguous-outlet quarantine. Test exhaustion followed by
   operator retry and verify both identities, limits and retained history.
   Inject unavailable provider and disappearing maker cases and inspect those outcomes. The head
   remains reachable throughout; healthy-provider response timing is measured
   separately from maker availability.
4. Runtime health measures successful creative cycles and usable dependencies,
   not merely an HTTP process. The current event configuration snapshot has a
   hardcoded `running: true`; replace that claim with actual lifecycle state.
   Verify disabled, stopped and enabled processes independently, including
   native gateway/clock ownership. Alerts are quiet while unchanged/non-actionable.
5. Cloud placement has independently available provider, memory/search and
   artifact dependencies; state the measured host availability and remaining
   mesh capabilities rather than claiming a mesh from network reachability.

## Verification

Source/build gates in each owning repo, deployment identity checks, actual
database vector query and artifact/publication recovery drill. Ship the human
runbook and scripts with exact images/contracts and a reversible cutover.

## Risks

Host sleep, cloud capacity, worker leases, duplicate consumers, Atlas search
readiness, private credential placement and data migration consistency.
