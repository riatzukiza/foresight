# E1.10 — Reviewer-start window protection

**Acceptance.** Main requires PRs, required build/test/lint/conformance results, resolved review conversations, and completed successful CodeRabbit review evidence for the exact head. Review absence, queueing, error, rate-limit, skipped review, stale-head evidence, or an unexpected producer cannot authorize merge.

## Tasks

- Discover actual emitted CodeRabbit check/status names and trusted app identity
- Require an always-present, trusted review-completion gate
- Prevent a PR from modifying the trusted gate to self-authorize
- Configure resolved conversations separately
- Scope agent permissions so bypass, force push, policy edits, and direct main writes are not their ordinary execution path
- Verify rules through API read-back and controlled PR fixtures

## Failing fixtures first

- Fresh PR before CodeRabbit starts
- Successful old SHA followed by a new push
- All checks green but one unresolved thread
- No review due to errors/rate limits
- Spoofed check producer
- A skipped test hidden by an aggregate
- Stale base requiring renewed verification

## Evidence

Policy JSON/read-back, app/check identity, negative and positive merge-eligibility tests, and exact-head reviewer state.

## Planning reference

See `docs/migrations/eta-mu-breakdown/epic-01-operation-eta-mu-breakdown.md` (E1.10).

PR #96 reconciliation: Unsupported done claim reopened through CLI. Trusted exact-head review-completion rollout remains tracked in https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/111. Policy read 403 is unavailable evidence, not proof that policy is absent. No policy is weakened and no completion is manufactured.

Issue #111 initial discovery is recorded in docs/review-rollout/: eight exact main revisions, readable ruleset summaries, emitted check/App identities and explicit HTTP 403 protection gaps. One positive and 22 negative conformance examples are proposed, not executed; reusable law is owned by eta-mu #330 and hosted fixtures by #297. Accepted eta-mu #304 fixes prerequisite artifact reuse; Foresight consumes that repair with OpenCode 1.18.31. No policy write or module enforcement acceptance occurred. E1.10 remains blocked pending E1.04, full authorized read-back and executed acceptance fixtures.

October6 PR112 planning refresh: merged parent PR96 at a4d7ed83466bc11d8a05ec6348eaa41794830ecb; ordinary main integration preserves exact snapshot/examples and historical ledger additions. Current reviewed caller pins now inherited from fcfc2d1. No new child-policy readback, protection write or executed conformance claim. E1.10 remains blocked on actual trusted-policy and fixture proof; published successor hosted planning review remains required.
