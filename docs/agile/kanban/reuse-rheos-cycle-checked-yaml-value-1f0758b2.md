# Reuse Rheos cycle-checked YAML value during frontmatter reads

## Context

[CodeRabbit review 5399591772](https://github.com/riatzukiza/rheos/pull/1#pullrequestreview-5399591772)
identified a trivial performance cost at Rheos commit
`04220846166dad35995f091945a7a6f1a2a4087f`.
The [source helper](https://github.com/riatzukiza/rheos/blob/04220846166dad35995f091945a7a6f1a2a4087f/src/rheos/backend/extern/yaml.cljs#L100)
converts a YAML Document and checks the resulting graph for cycles. The
[read path](https://github.com/riatzukiza/rheos/blob/04220846166dad35995f091945a7a6f1a2a4087f/src/rheos/backend/extern/yaml.cljs#L113)
immediately converts the same unchanged Document again with identical options.
Both calls were synchronous, with no intervening mutation or callback. That
initial reuse review demonstrated no cycle-check bypass. Later source review
reproduced a separate native ordered-map cycle guard gap; the preservation
story records its focused red tests and guard repair. Reuse qualification must
include that repaired refusal behavior.

This began as standalone intake, not a child of the eleven-point preparation
epic. The bounded reuse was implemented in
[Rheos 93783d7](https://github.com/riatzukiza/rheos/commit/93783d75b0e0752ffa7da6d4d76ca24c4f75047b)
and remains present at
[source 3bc5df2](https://github.com/riatzukiza/rheos/blob/3bc5df2d591a6976a627fe20c806310ebfaf92da/src/rheos/backend/extern/yaml.cljs#L99):
the private extern helper performs one native Document conversion and
`read-frontmatter` reuses that checked value. The
[preservation story](preserve-rheos-metadata-at-real-write-boundary-819717c4.md)
records the implementation and its existing regression qualification. This card
remains incoming for explicit source-range and named-fixture qualification with
exact commands, revision and independent review disposition. No latency or
memory benchmark is required unless a measured improvement is claimed; no
readiness or broader preservation-story completion is asserted. The Rheos fork
has issues disabled, so the follow-up remains on the authoritative Foresight
board without changing repository settings.

## Outcome

Each frontmatter read reuses its already converted, cycle-checked native value,
removing one full graph conversion and allocation while preserving public data
and refusal behavior. No measured latency or memory improvement is claimed yet.

## Scope

- Implementation owner: `open-hax/rheos`.
- Keep the reuse inside `rheos.backend.extern.yaml`; a private helper can return
  the Document and its checked native value, while range callers use only the
  Document.
- Preserve Clojure-shaped public results, lexical top-level scalar values,
  nested core-schema types, standard-tag validation, alias limits and
  deterministic cycle refusal.
- Use the existing parser and writeback regression fixtures and full gates.

## Non-goals

- No new YAML parser, board engine or alternate command surface in Foresight.
- No provider/CMS implementation, general serialization or board lifecycle change.
- No refused-source visibility work; that has its own five-point follow-up.
- No change to the preservation repair's verified behavior or qualification claim.

## Acceptance criteria

- A frontmatter read performs one native Document conversion and uses the graph
  that was checked for cycles.
- Native YAML objects stay inside the extern adapter; consumers receive the
  same portable data and source ranges as before.
- Existing cycle-versus-shared-alias, typed nested metadata, scalar spelling,
  tag compatibility, BOM and unchanged-body fixtures pass.
- The declared full test and lint gates pass at the repaired revision.
- Any reported latency or memory benefit includes representative before/after
  measurement; removing a conversion alone is not a performance benchmark.

## Verification

Inspect the real read path at a pinned revision, qualify it with existing focused
fixtures and the repository's declared full gates, and record exact commands,
revisions and review dispositions. Identify the exact named fixtures and
source-range parity results for this card; the preservation story's broad green
counts do not alone establish that remaining qualification. Add a new test only
if a newly exposed behavior needs coverage. Use Rheos for board reads and future
transitions.

## Risks

Moving native values across the extern boundary would weaken the portable data
contract. Reusing unchecked data or changing alias options could change refusal
behavior. If profiling or broad reader changes enlarge the work, split it before
readiness.
