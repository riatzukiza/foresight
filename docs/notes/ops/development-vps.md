# Development VPS deployment

This is a historical Knoxx host note, not a statement about a Foresight checkout
or a freshly verified deployment. The extracted setup described a source-based
development instance alongside containerized Knoxx. Commands below belong to
that host context and require its operator configuration.

## Installed host prerequisites

- Node.js 22.23.2 in `/usr/local`
- pnpm 10.15.1 through Corepack
- Clojure CLI 1.12.4.1582 in `/usr/local`
- The root, `backend`, and `frontend` pnpm lockfiles installed independently
- PM2 6.0.13 for the three long-running development processes

Java 21 was already installed on the VPS.

## Local development environment

The ignored repository-root `.env` contains the development API key and public
URL overrides. Generate three independent random secrets: one for
`KNOXX_API_KEY`, one for the OpenAI-compatible `MODEL_LAB_OPENAI_API_KEY`
boundary, and one for `KNOXX_BOOTSTRAP_SYSTEM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, the password
login for the `pi@open-hax.local` bootstrap system administrator. Keep API keys
in backend/operator configuration, never browser-delivered environment or assets.
The historical note described credential reuse; this correction is guidance,
not evidence that any running host has rotated its credentials. None of these
secrets belongs in source control. Load the host's shared Knoxx configuration
first, then the development overrides:

```bash
set -a
source /home/err/.env
source /home/err/spaces/knoxx/.env
set +a
```

Retrieve the development API key locally when needed:

```bash
sed -n 's/^KNOXX_API_KEY=//p' /home/err/spaces/knoxx/.env
```

The frontend login credentials are:

```text
Email: pi@open-hax.local
Password: the KNOXX_BOOTSTRAP_SYSTEM_ADMIN_PASSWORD value in .env
```

On backend startup this identity is repeatably assigned `system-admin` and its
local password credential is upserted. Updating the environment value and
restarting the development backend rotates the password.

The key is a randomly generated 256-bit hexadecimal value. Never copy it into a
tracked file.

Knoxx links `@open-hax/openplanner-sdk` from the sibling OpenPlanner checkout.
That dependency was installed at `/home/err/spaces/openplanner` and its
`openplanner-document-hydration` and `openplanner-sdk` packages were built. No
OpenPlanner source was changed.

## Processes and ports

Run the backend compiler, backend server, and frontend development server from
three shells after loading the environment above:

```bash
pnpm -C backend run watch
pnpm -C backend run start:dev
pnpm -C frontend run dev
```

The source backend listens on `0.0.0.0:8000`; the source frontend listens on
`:5173` and proxies `/api`, `/ws`, and `/health` to the backend. Caddy routes
`https://knoxx-dev.promethean.rest` to the frontend through
the `open-hax` Docker bridge gateway at `172.18.0.1:5173`.

UFW permits TCP `5173` and `8000` only from the internal `172.18.0.0/16`
Docker bridge so Caddy can reach the source frontend and direct backend routes.
Neither development port is opened to the public internet.

The frontend shadow-cljs server owns its default control port `9630`, so the
backend shadow-cljs server selects `9631`. The ignored `.env` explicitly points
the backend launcher at `http://127.0.0.1:9631` and allows four minutes for the
initial cold compile.

The processes are saved under PM2 as `knoxx-dev-shadow`,
`knoxx-dev-backend`, and `knoxx-dev-frontend`. The `pm2-err` systemd unit is
enabled so the saved process list is resurrected after a VPS reboot. Inspect
them with:

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs knoxx-dev-backend
```

The dev backend's saved PM2 environment reuses the deployed Knoxx container's
Atlas MongoDB URI and Proxx authentication token. It overrides the deployed
service's `openplanner` database name with `MONGODB_DB=knoxx_dev`, keeping the
development policy, sessions, runs, and OpenPlanner SDK data isolated in a new
database on the same Atlas cluster. Credentials are not written into this
checkout. Recreate the process environment from the host service configuration
if the deployed service rotates either credential.

## DNS and ingress

Cloudflare has an A record for `knoxx-dev.promethean.rest` pointing to the VPS
public address `157.245.125.134`. Caddy terminates HTTPS and forwards this
hostname to the development frontend. The Caddy configuration is owned by the
host service layer at `/srv/open-hax/services/caddy/Caddyfile`, outside this
repository.

Validate the public route with:

```bash
curl --fail --show-error \
  -H "X-API-Key: $KNOXX_API_KEY" \
  https://knoxx-dev.promethean.rest/health
```

## Verification

After dependency or backend changes, use the repository-required checks:

```bash
pnpm -C backend run typecheck
pnpm -C backend exec shadow-cljs compile test
pnpm -C frontend run typecheck
pnpm -C frontend run test
pnpm -C frontend run test:cljs
```
