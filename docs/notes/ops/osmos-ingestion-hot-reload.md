 Signal

 Yes — for the Clojure ingestion backend, the equivalent pattern is a
 “reloaded workflow” via nREPL plus namespace refresh. It is not exactly
 Shadow-CLJS hot module reload, but we can get close: keep the JVM alive,
 reload changed namespaces, and keep Jetty serving through a Var.

 Evidence

 The current ingestion backend already has one important hot-reload-friendly
 piece:

 ```clojure
   (jetty/run-jetty #'wrapped-app {:port port :join? true})
 ```

 That #'wrapped-app matters. Jetty dereferences the Var at request time, so if
 wrapped-app is redefined in the running JVM, Jetty can see the new handler
 without restarting the Jetty server.

 Current state:

 - ingestion/deps.edn already has a :dev alias with:
     - nrepl/nrepl
     - cider/cider-nrepl
 - Server is Ring/Reitit/Jetty.
 - The main lifecycle is all inside -main:
     - DB init
     - source bootstrap
     - worker executor init
     - scheduler start
     - watcher start
     - optional translation worker start
     - Jetty start

 That means handler code is reloadable, but the lifecycle resources need
 structure before fully smooth hot reload.

 Frames

 1. Fastest dev loop: run the JVM under nREPL, eval changed namespaces, and
 rely on #'wrapped-app for handler updates.
 2. Proper reloaded workflow: add dev/kms_ingestion/dev.clj with start, stop,
 and reset; use tools.namespace or clj-reload to reload changed namespaces and
 restart only lifecycle resources.
 3. Shadow-like coarse mode: use a file watcher to restart the whole Clojure
 process on .clj changes; less elegant, but reliable for stateful
 worker/scheduler code.

 Countermoves

 - I would not try to mimic Shadow exactly. JVM Clojure hot reload works best
 when app state is explicit and restartable.
 - The scheduler/watcher/worker threads need stop functions before aggressive
 namespace refresh is safe; otherwise reloads can leave zombie background
 threads.
 - Pure route/handler edits are easiest; DB pool, executor, watcher, and
 translation worker changes need lifecycle discipline.

 Next

 Add a :repl/:dev reloaded workflow for ingestion with explicit start, stop,
 and reset functions around Jetty, scheduler, watcher, worker executor, and
 translation worker.
