Aight, this is progress.
I was hopin the rendered preview would be more like a side bar so I could  keep interacting with
the board with it open,
it's gotta understand  the frontmatter also,
giving me an interface to change the frontmatter.

It's rendering the front matter as if it were part of the markdown right now
I want the system to interpret section breaks `---` as comments after the frontmatter, and main body

so:

# Knoxx Backend Lint — Test Boundaries and Async Cleanup

> Source: `specs/tasks/knoxx-backend-lint-test-boundaries.md`
> Points: 5

Date: 2026-05-27
Status: todo
Parent epic: `specs/epics/knoxx-backend-cljs-lint-remediation.md`
Story points: 5

## Purpose

Make backend tests respect public API boundaries, modern async style, required protocol methods, and namespace requirements while preserving regression coverage.

## Problem

The lint run reports test-specific blockers and warnings:

- private-var access in `pipeline_runner_test.cljs`, `policy_actor_test.cljs`, and `tools/temp_memory_test.cljs`;
- raw `.then`/`.catch` Promise chains across many test files;

We've gotten rid of all of  the long function errors in lint
```


the last one shows up as a comment.

And we have an interface in here to *add* comments.
