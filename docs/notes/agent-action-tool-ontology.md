# Agent

There is really no thing to point at say "that thing is an agent"
An agent emerges from context

It's tools are just a registry of actions it's allowed to perform, and instructions

We want these actions to be legible to any system

I want a registry of actions seperate from the registry of tools

A tool is functor that wraps an action in instructions and guards
