## #μ Driver-Agnostic Migration Protocol

> **Historical design / lift candidate, not implemented migration authority.**
> The retired PostgreSQL and atom drivers below are corrected illustrative
> sketches. They do not establish tables, transactionality, sandbox safety, or
> a production migration service. A real driver must validate specs before
> evaluation and persist the exact affected IDs for restart-safe rollback.

The core model: a **migration** is a named, versioned, pure transformation over the contract data graph. It is not a SQL `ALTER TABLE`. It is not tied to any storage format. It describes **what changed in the domain** and provides a `up` fn that transforms the old shape to the new shape — the driver then projects that transformation into whatever store it manages.

```
MigrationSpec (EDN)
  :migration/id        — unique, sortable, e.g. "2026-04-27-001-rename-actor-kind"
  :migration/version   — integer (monotonic)
  :migration/entity    — which entity kind is affected (:org :role :actor :capability :tool-policy ...)
  :migration/transform — pure fn: old-shape → new-shape (SCI-eval'd from :migration/expr)
  :migration/expr      — EDN form of the transform fn (portable, storable)
  :migration/predicate — optional: old-shape → bool (which records to migrate)
  :migration/reversible — bool
  :migration/down-expr  — required reverse transform when reversible
  :migration/down-predicate — required post-migration selector when reversible
```

The driver receives a `MigrationSpec` and applies it to every matching record in its store. SQL gets `UPDATE`s. Atoms get `swap!`s. XTDB gets transactions. The migration is agnostic to all of them.

## #μ Example Migration Contracts

### Rename a field across all actors

```edn
;; contracts/migrations/2026-04-27-001-actor-kind-agent-to-system.edn
{:migration/id          "2026-04-27-001-actor-kind-agent-to-system"
 :migration/version     1
 :migration/entity      :actor
 :migration/description "Rename :actor/kind :agent → :system for non-human actors"
 :migration/predicate   (fn [r] (= :agent (:actor/kind r)))
 :migration/expr        (fn [r] (assoc r :actor/kind :system))
 :migration/reversible  true
 :migration/down-expr   (fn [r] (assoc r :actor/kind :agent))
 :migration/down-predicate (fn [r] (= :system (:actor/kind r)))}
```

The rename sketch assumes no pre-existing `:system` actors in its migration
scope. The down predicate addresses post-migration state, not the original
`:agent` predicate. If that assumption cannot be proved, persist the selected
stable IDs before the forward write and select only those IDs on rollback; a
value-only predicate must not roll back unrelated records. Production drivers
must also retain those IDs durably across restarts and handle partial writes.

### Add a default field to all roles

```edn
;; contracts/migrations/2026-04-27-002-role-add-scope.edn
{:migration/id          "2026-04-27-002-role-add-scope"
 :migration/version     2
 :migration/entity      :role
 :migration/description "Backfill :role/scope :org on all roles lacking it"
 :migration/predicate   (fn [r] (nil? (:role/scope r)))
 :migration/expr        (fn [r] (assoc r :role/scope :org))
 :migration/reversible  false}
```

### Promote permissions to explicit tool policies

```edn
;; contracts/migrations/2026-04-27-003-permissions-to-tool-policies.edn
{:migration/id          "2026-04-27-003-permissions-to-tool-policies"
 :migration/version     3
 :migration/entity      :role
 :migration/description "Derive :role/tool-policies from :role/permissions tool.* entries"
 :migration/predicate   (fn [r] (empty? (:role/tool-policies r)))
 :migration/expr
 (fn [r]
   (let [tool-perms (->> (:role/permissions r)
                         (filter #(clojure.string/starts-with? % "tool."))
                         (map (fn [p]
                                {:toolId (-> p
                                            (clojure.string/replace-first #"^tool\." "")
                                            (clojure.string/replace #"\." "."))
                                 :effect "allow"})))]
     (assoc r :role/tool-policies (vec tool-perms))))
 :migration/reversible false}
```

## Execution Order at Boot

```clojure
;; In bootstrap.cljs / entrypoint.cljs
(js-await [_       (driver/ensure-schema! pg-driver)
           _       (migration-runner/run-pending! pg-migration-driver config)
           result  (contract-sync/sync-all! pg-driver config)]
  (println "[boot] migrations + sync complete" result))
```

The sequence is:

1. **`ensure-schema!`** — DDL, creates `contract_migrations` table
2. **`run-pending!`** — applies any new migration EDN files not yet in the log
3. **`sync-all!`** — upserts current contract state (roles, actors, orgs, caps)

Migrations run **before** sync, so the transform shapes the data before the fresh contract values land on top of it .

## Invariants

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Migration exprs are pure — no I/O, no side effects | SCI sandbox; no `js/fetch`, no atoms |
| Migration IDs are immutable once applied | `record-migration!` uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` |
| Contracts are additive — sync never deletes | Only migrations explicitly delete |
| Down migrations only run on explicit rollback call | `run-pending!` never calls `rollback-migration!` |
| Driver decides *how* to write — migration decides *what* to change | Protocol boundary is `apply-migration!` |
