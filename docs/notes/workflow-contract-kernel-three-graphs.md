 Signal

 I think your intent is not “make the skill graph smarter.”

 Your intent is: build a deterministic workflow/contract kernel where agent
 work moves through explicit, valid states, and every transition is justified
 by machine-checkable contracts, not inferred vibes.

 The skill-graph-aco experiment was pointing at a real desire:

 - agents should not just freewheel;
 - agents should know what phase of work they are in;
 - agents should be pushed from phase to phase by a workflow graph;
 - “you’re not done” should become a typed transition failure, not a scolding
 loop;
 - task files should be the durable state;
 - skills should help execute phases, not define the FSM by statistical
 co-occurrence.

 But the implementation substrate was wrong:

 - it ran over all skills;
 - it inferred edges from historical usage;
 - it treated learned association as if it could imply valid workflow
 adjacency;
 - it lacked deterministic proof that a transition was allowed;
 - it mixed “capability graph” with “process graph.”

 So yes: do not keep skill-graph-aco.

 The thing you are reaching for is closer to:

 ```text
   Task FSM + Contract DSL + Deterministic Transition Guards + Evidence Ledger
 ```

 not:

 ```text
   ACO over skill invocation history
 ```

 Evidence

 The kanban/process artifacts already encode the correct shape.

 From docs/reference/process.md, the workflow is explicitly an FSM:

 - states are board columns;
 - transitions are named edges;
 - transition rules are predicates over a task;
 - task status is single-source-of-truth;
 - board generation follows task files;
 - WIP and gates are deterministic blockers;
 - “Done” does not casually back-edge; follow-ups become new tasks.

 That is already the correct conceptual substrate.

 The kanban-fsm skill also says the same thing in compressed form:

 - canonical states;
 - canonical transitions;
 - gates;
 - invariants;
 - normalization.

 The Promethean kanban task files matter because they are already structured
 the way the tool expected. That means the durable state model is not
 hypothetical. The task files are not just notes; they are candidate contract
 instances.

 The policy/contract repositories you pointed at suggest a second axis:

 - proxx/src/proxx/policy/
 - proxx/resources/policies/
 - proxx/pseudo/policy.edn
 - openplanner/packages/agents/knoxx/contracts/

 Those are not “the same implementation drifting.” They look more like separate
 projections of a larger DSL:

 - Proxx policy expresses routing/enforcement/selection logic.
 - Knoxx contracts express actors, agents, actions, models, roles, and runtime
 permissions.
 - Kanban expresses task workflow state and transition gates.
 - Eta-mu skills/contracts express agent behavior, process rules, and local
 operational doctrine.

 The unifying object is not “skill graph.” It is “contract graph with typed
 relations and verified edges.”

 Frames

 The clean mental model is three different graphs, not one inferred graph.

 First: the workflow FSM graph.

 This is deterministic. It answers:

 ```text
   Can task T move from state A to state B?
 ```

 Edges here must be authored or derived from canonical FSM specs. They cannot
 be inferred from usage. A transition is valid only if:

 - source state matches;
 - target state is allowed;
 - WIP rules pass;
 - required fields/evidence exist;
 - blockers are resolved;
 - acceptance criteria are satisfied for that phase.

 Second: the capability/skill graph.

 This is advisory. It answers:

 ```text
   Which skills/tools might help in this state or with this task?
 ```

 This graph can tolerate heuristics, rankings, embeddings, ACO, similarity,
 history, etc. But it cannot authorize state transitions. It can recommend. It
 cannot decide.

 Third: the contract/proof graph.

 This is the DSL you are circling.

 It answers:

 ```text
   What claims, roles, permissions, predicates, policies, and invariants prove
 that this action or transition is allowed?
 ```

 This is where Proxx policy, Knoxx contracts, eta-mu contracts, and Kanban
 gates should converge.

 The missing kernel is a typed relation layer. Something like:

 ```clojure
   {:edge/id :kanban.transition/in-progress->in-review
    :edge/type :fsm.transition
    :from :kanban.status/in-progress
    :to :kanban.status/in-review
    :requires [:task.has-reviewable-change
               :task.evidence.recorded
               :workspace.tests.selected-pass]
    :forbids [:task.major-blocker/open]
    :proof-mode :deterministic}
 ```

 And separately:

 ```clojure
   {:edge/id :skill.suggest/regression-triage-for-testing-failure
    :edge/type :recommendation
    :from :kanban.status/testing
    :to :skill/regression-triage
    :basis [:task.test-failure.present]
    :proof-mode :advisory}
 ```

 Those should not be the same kind of edge.

 The ACO mistake was collapsing these into one learned graph. It treated “often
 follows” as if it could become “may transition.” That is exactly the wrong
 move for an FSM.

 Countermoves

 Do not resurrect skill-graph-aco as a CLJS port.

 If anything survives from it, it is only the observation that agents need
 phase guidance. The ACO mechanism, inferred Markov edges, semantic similarity
 over all skills, and global skill co-occurrence graph should not be part of
 the authoritative workflow system.

 Do not try to unify all contract implementations by forcing them into one file
 format immediately. That will probably flatten useful distinctions.

 Instead, treat the current implementations as dialects or projections of a
 larger DSL:

 - Kanban task files are workflow-instance contracts.
 - Kanban FSM specs are transition contracts.
 - Proxx policies are routing/enforcement contracts.
 - Knoxx contracts are actor/agent/runtime capability contracts.
 - Eta-mu skills are operator/capability/process contracts.

 The right next abstraction is probably not “one schema to rule them all.” It
 is a meta-contract vocabulary that can say:

 ```text
   this thing defines a state
   this thing defines a transition
   this thing defines a predicate
   this thing defines a role
   this thing defines a permission
   this thing defines an action
   this thing defines evidence
   this thing defines a proof obligation
   this thing is advisory only
   this thing is authoritative
 ```

 Then each existing DSL can be mapped into that vocabulary without erasing its
 local purpose.

 The abductive prover belongs here, but only behind a verification boundary. It
 may propose relationships, missing predicates, or candidate mappings. It must
 not bless them as FSM edges unless deterministic validation accepts them.

 Next

 1. Write a short canonical spec called something like
 contracts/workflow-contract-graph-v1.md that explicitly separates
 authoritative FSM edges, advisory skill recommendations, and proof-bearing
 contract relations, then map Kanban, Proxx policy, Knoxx contracts, and eta-mu
 skill contracts into that three-graph model.
 Signal

 I think the intent is:

 You are not trying to build an adaptive graph over “all skills.” That was the
 wrong substrate.

 You are trying to build a deterministic workflow controller for agent work,
 where the agent can be moved through phases like:

 ```text
   Incoming → Accepted → Breakdown → Ready → Todo → In Progress → In Review →
 Testing → Document → Done
 ```

 That controller should operate over task/workflow state, not over skill
 co-occurrence.

 The old skill-graph-aco experiment was trying to do something adjacent to a
 RALPH loop: if the agent is not done, push it into a better next phase. But it
 tried to infer phase edges from the whole skill graph, which is unsound
 because skills are capabilities, not workflow states.

 So: yes, we should not keep skill-graph-aco.

 The correct shape is:

 - FSM edges are explicit and verified.
 - Skills are tools/actions available inside phases.
 - Task files are the structured runtime records.
 - Contracts/policies define gates, permissions, obligations, and transition
 validity.
 - Abductive/probabilistic logic may propose relationships, but may not define
 valid FSM edges unless a deterministic verifier accepts them.

 Evidence

 The process reference in
 orgs/octave-commons/gates-of-aker/docs/reference/process.md already names the
 lifecycle:

 ```text
   Incoming -> Accepted -> Breakdown -> Ready -> Todo -> In Progress -> In
 Review -> Testing -> Document -> Done
 ```

 The eta-mu Kanban package has a related status ordering in
 packages/kanban/src/types.ts:

 ```ts
   icebox
   incoming
   accepted
   breakdown
   blocked
   ready
   todo
   in_progress
   review
   document
   done
   rejected
 ```

 The current kanban-fsm skill in pi/agent/skills/kanban-fsm/CONTRACT.edn
 already captures the right idea but only partially:

 - normalization aliases
 - invariants
 - frontmatter requirements
 - state/priority gates

 The Promethean kanban CLI appears to be the historical implementation that
 expected task files in a particular structure.

 The Proxx policy DSL shows a more mature declarative contract shape:

 - :contract/id
 - :contract/kind
 - :policy/condition
 - :policy/filters
 - :policy/outcome
 - :policy/children
 - ordered manifests
 - runtime routing phases
 - deterministic selection/fallback/backtracking behavior

 Knoxx contracts similarly encode actors, agents, actions, capabilities, and
 runtime bindings as EDN contract data.

 Those are not necessarily conflicting systems. They look like separate
 projections of a larger contract DSL:

 - workflow/state-machine contracts
 - policy/routing contracts
 - actor/agent/capability contracts
 - task/frontmatter contracts
 - output/repair contracts
 - proof/evidence contracts

 The drift is that each projection has its own schema/runtime conventions, not
 that the concepts are fundamentally incompatible.

 Frames

 The corrected model should be:

 ```text
   Task FSM
     owns: states, transitions, gates, valid next states

   Task files
     own: work item identity, current state, priority, evidence, refs, notes

   Skills
     own: capabilities/actions that may be invoked during a state

   Contracts
     own: declarative obligations, permissions, invariants, policy clauses

   Verifier
     owns: deterministic validation of transitions and relationships

   Abductive prover
     owns: proposing missing links, likely next states, candidate contract
 mappings

   Controller / RALPH-like loop
     owns: repeatedly asking “what state am I in, what gate is unmet, what must
 happen next?”
 ```

 The key distinction:

 ```text
   skill graph edge ≠ workflow transition
 ```

 A skill graph edge like:

 ```text
   testing-general → regression-triage
 ```

 might be useful as a recommendation. It cannot mean:

 ```text
   In Review → Testing
 ```

 unless the FSM contract says that transition exists and the gate verifier says
 its conditions are satisfied.

 The abductive prover belongs in the “proposal” layer:

 - “This task probably belongs in breakdown.”
 - “This contract looks like a policy clause.”
 - “This skill may satisfy this phase.”
 - “This missing edge might be implied by these task examples.”

 But the verifier must decide:

 - Is this a declared edge?
 - Is this edge derived from a trusted rule?
 - Is the source/target type correct?
 - Are required frontmatter fields present?
 - Are gate conditions met?
 - Is there evidence for the transition?
 - Is the proposed relation admissible, rejected, or quarantined?

 So the system should be proof-carrying, not inference-trusting.

 Countermoves

 Do not resurrect skill-graph-aco as-is.

 Do not base FSM transition edges on:

 - skill co-occurrence
 - embedding similarity
 - LLM-generated relationships
 - pheromone weights
 - “agents often did X after Y”

 Those can generate hints. They cannot define workflow law.

 The better consolidation target is a contract DSL kernel with typed aspects.
 For example:

 ```edn
   {:contract/id :kanban/fsm
    :contract/kind :workflow-fsm
    :fsm/states [...]
    :fsm/transitions [...]
    :fsm/gates [...]}
 ```

 ```edn
   {:contract/id :proxx.policy.runtime/manifest
    :contract/kind :policy-manifest
    :policy.loader/order [...]
    :policy.loader/invariant "..."}
 ```

 ```edn
   {:contract/id :agent/developer
    :contract/kind :agent
    :agent/roles [...]
    :agent/tools [...]
    :agent/policies [...]}
 ```

 These can coexist if each has:

 - a declared :contract/kind
 - a schema for that kind
 - explicit references to other contracts
 - deterministic validators
 - projection-specific compilers/runtimes

 The central thing you need is not one giant merged EDN file. It is a canonical
 contract registry and verifier that knows which contract kinds exist, how
 references resolve, and what proof is required for derived relationships.

 Next

 - Create a short canonical spec for the unified contract/workflow kernel:
 define :workflow-fsm, :task, :transition-gate, :policy-program, :agent,
 :actor, :capability, and :proof contract kinds; state that inferred/abductive
 edges are only :candidate until accepted by a deterministic verifier; then map
 existing Kanban, Proxx, and Knoxx files into those kinds without changing
 their runtimes yet.
