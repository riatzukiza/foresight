# Module acceptance register

This register distinguishes **registered in PR #96** from **accepted for
standalone use**. None of the registrations below asserts E1.01–E1.10 completion.
The candidate pins were cloned successfully during reconciliation. The root
inventory, project and catalog tests validate Foresight's registration surface;
they do not certify a child's build, behavior, policy, or production readiness.

Every child's declared gates were executed once from a fresh clone outside any
eta-mu workspace; the exit codes, the failures and the tool-unavailable rows are
in [child-gate-evidence.md](child-gate-evidence.md). That execution is one
observation on one host and accepts nothing: the rows above stay `Pending` until
each owning repository merges its evidence under the procedure below.

`data/registration.json` is the machine-readable companion. Gate entries in
`config/quality-gates.edn` cite files at these pins. Missing commands are explicit
unavailable entries; no no-op is treated as a quality gate. E1.09 requires
repository-owned counts, reports, coverage policy and complete guidance before
acceptance. Registering Receipt River expanded the original eight-target plan
to nine direct registrations; the original eight included existing Axxium.

## Verified baseline and reachability

Axxium now uses the officially merged [PR #12 baseline](https://github.com/open-hax/axxium/pull/12),
not unaccepted reconciliation candidate `ee5284a00eb5c034cd6ef0db281726f00ce77cca`.
Exact-baseline checks `99316860917` (build) and `99316860993`
(deployment-boundary) passed. The build log reports six compiler warnings and
zero tests/zero assertions; these limits remain visible and do not certify the
extraction upgrade. The gate catalog now exposes the baseline's missing lint
script as unavailable.

Receipt River pin `7c7c62343fea0241ac545e37f14e57ab344bfa30` was verified by
the GitHub commit API and a fresh empty repository fetching that full SHA from
`https://github.com/open-hax/receipt-river.git` on September 19. This proves
reachability, not standalone test or cutover acceptance.

The root `eta-mu` gitlink stays at the donor baseline
`0ed56aa74a53a1d1e9c2e55ce95451817a7f3a90`. The candidate
`c2bbf7547592cb9e0c82eee01c2b01555c6cee68` was withdrawn: its two commits are
E1.11 donor retirement, and at that revision nine remaining packages hold
references to directories the retirement deleted. The detail and its
reproduction are in
[donor-retirement-blockers.md](donor-retirement-blockers.md). Withdrawing the
candidate changes no child registration.

At the earlier migration reconciliation, the Foresight review caller consumed officially merged
[eta-mu PR #304](https://github.com/open-hax/eta-mu/pull/304) at
`e8eea02d31030215984375980b765803fc72d80d`, preserving prerequisite artifact
names on failed-job reruns. Its 36 executable workflow tests passed locally.
OpenCode is pinned to official release `1.18.31`; a direct free-model probe
succeeded after `1.18.18` was rejected by the provider. The actual PR review
still requires a successful exact-head hosted run; a probe is not that review.

The October 3 review restoration repins the caller to immutable
`b5b28237c45323cdc1914317260192163d957735`, the executable workflow repair
carried by merged [eta-mu PR #339](https://github.com/open-hax/eta-mu/pull/339).
That pin is intentional across later provenance-only parent commits. The
migration-pack gate disables Python bytecode emission to preserve the required
clean checkout. Foresight [PR #121's run](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/actions/runs/37106880496)
passed all twelve deterministic gates and completed a real MiMo review on
`12104524e9b96d432116ffddc72aa5f93503043b`; this is evidence for that revision,
not advance approval of a later documentation head or standalone child acceptance.

## Lifecycle reconciliation

The original E1.01–E1.10 cards declared `done` without matching canonical
completion histories. Present-time CLI comments explain each gap. Legal
`done → review → in_progress` reopening preserves the observed prior card state;
it does not invent historical testing/review events. E1.01 and E1.05 remain in
progress; E1.02–E1.04 and E1.06–E1.10 proceed through `breakdown → blocked`.
E1.11–E1.12 remain todo, subject to their recorded prerequisites.

The original “6 new repos” comment is preserved as history and corrected by a
new CLI comment: eight original targets minus existing Axxium equals **seven**
new repositories. Receipt River was added later.

## Accepted-module documentation procedure

When the owning module PR is merged and its exact accepted commit has the
required evidence, update the following together in the Foresight repin PR:

1. Record the merge URL, full accepted SHA, exact-revision test/build/lint and
   applicable consumer/image/browser evidence, plus actual required review
   results. Missing or inaccessible evidence leaves acceptance pending.
2. Update the gitlink, this register and `data/registration.json`; replace the
   pending row only for that module. Keep original snapshots as historical data.
3. Refresh `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, project routing, the quality-gate catalog,
   and the typed dependency disposition. Scope shared abstractions to Foresight;
   child product guidance remains independently usable.
4. Check the child README commands and AGENTS at the accepted commit. Move
   suite-level documents only with E1.12's source/destination and link map.
5. Append canonical receipts and use lawful CLI transitions with evidence.
   Acceptance does not authorize donor deletion: E1.11 still requires zero live
   inbound edges and consumer regression evidence.

## Follow-up ownership

- [#107 Truth](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/107),
  [#108 .agents](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/108),
  [#109 Calliope](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/109), and
  [#110 Services](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/110) own separate
  validated repins. PR #96 restores these four paths to the current main pins.
- [#111](https://github.com/open-hax/foresight/issues/111) owns E1.10's trusted
  review-completion rollout. Policy reads returning 403 are unavailable;
  they neither prove absent policy nor authorize weaker protection.
- E1.03/E1.06/E1.07 own cold dependency and consumer closure;
  E1.08 owns Osmos compatibility; E1.09 owns honest child quality gates;
  E1.12 owns the final documentation transfer after accepted cutovers.

## Receipt provenance

The original multiline root ledger is archived byte-for-byte under
`.ημ/archive/pr96-c551e986/root-receipts.edn` (SHA-256
`a9a0f48df3aaf53cec1a0d34f7551e77850577cb9d6a8c38543363643b3fffed`).
The original planning-upload receipt is preserved beside it, SHA-256
`40a811fcb1415bc28dd94391690fd270ce80b47eb2f125bdec74aae91c3ad033`.
Canonical `.ημ/receipts.edn` keeps main's historical prefix unchanged and
appends schema-valid import/correction records. Imported completion claims are
**reported history**, not admitted execution evidence.

The recovered 33-file planning ZIP is 329,573 bytes, SHA-256
`60c2af81121cc94568ee4f5b777b7708a57a5bf18cd95a5f3c0e77d2d40772c1`.
This identifies the recovered archive bytes. It does not retrospectively prove
the original author's claimed upload/download comparison or any product tests.
